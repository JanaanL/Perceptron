This is a machine learning library developed by Janaan Lake for CS5350 at the University of Utah.

The perceptron.py library contains the naive Perceptron, Voted Perceptron and Averaged Perceptron algorithms.  Currently, they are used on the bank note dataset found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+note.

To run these algorithms, run the following script on the command line: 
python3 perceptron.py

Alternatively, run the run.sh shell script.  

This will run all of the perceptron algorithms.  The results and the corresponding weight vectors for each algorithm will be printed on the screen.
